# TaskList-React
Implementing a task list manager in React.
Working on the frontend part only, using `localStorage` for data storage.

## Feature
* Each Task must have a title, description is optional, and an icon.
* User can add, edit, and delete the task.
* User can edit the task's description, icon, and status.
* There are three task status types: in progress Completed and Won't work on.
* User can edit the board name and the board description.

## Learning in React
* Structuring the react application.
* Working with typescript + react.
* Data transfer from parent to child component.
* Form handling in react, validation, and error handling.
* Working with `services` or `context API` to share component data.
* Up-lifting the state.

## Things to keep in mind
* Create `types` or `interfaces` for each component, state, or service.
* Please keep in mind all the functionalities before you implement them.
* Follow the folder structure.
* Try to divide the application components into smaller parts like `micro-frontends`.
* Try to implement the UI pixel perfectly.
* Use models for forms - add, edit, and delete functionality.

## Mistakes
* Implemented the whole solution using prop-drilling, should be implemented using `contextAPI` or some other state management library.
* Created reuseable component and pages in the same folder i.e `components`, should be, reuseable components -> `components` and pages -> `pages`.
